# Introduction

The Open Data Biodiversity Mapper (ODBM) is a tool intended to provide information on biodiveristy hotspots within Norway. It highlights
regions where red-listed species are likely to be found, for the purposes of enabling policy decisions regarding the
protection or restoration of said regions. The tool uses openly available data, fed through integrated species distribution
models, to analyse where these regions can be found in Norway.

The following document provides all the information needed to understand the communication tool chosen to visualise results - a Shiny app. It will detail
the set-up of the tool, as well as the code required to produce it. For any further information, or to make requests for additions to the documentation, 
please contact Sam Wenaas Perrin at sam.perrin@ntnu.no.

# Data Provision

All code used to turn the raw data into the Shiny app can be found in the **[BioDivMapping Github repository](https://github.com/gjearevoll/BioDivMapping)**
in the folder `visualisation`. All code used to produce said data can be found throughout the rest of the repository - this is detailed in a separate 
document, entitled "The Open Data Biodiversity Mapper - Software Documentation".

The Shiny app is split into two files - server.R and ui.R. For more information on how a Shiny app functions with regard to user interface and server
interaction, you can check out Shiny's [Welcome to Shiny walkthrough](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html).

An alpha version of the Shiny app is available [at this link](https://swp-data-projects.shinyapps.io/odbm/).

As opposed to the documentation for the rest of the data pipeline, here the tool description will be structured after the tabs that make up the Shiny tool.
